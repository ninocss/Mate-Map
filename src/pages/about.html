            <p class="subtitle">
                Mate Maps helps you quickly find Club-Mate and other mate drinks near you:
                kiosks, bars, cafés, and late‑night spots that stock your favorite fuel.

                Powered by community contributions and Leaflet.js. All maps are provided by OpenStreetMap.

            <h2>My Mission</h2>
            <p>
                Mate Maps was created for people who don’t want to waste time wandering from
                shop to shop hoping they still have Club‑Mate in stock.

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                Enter a city or ZIP code on the home page and I’ll show you places that are
                known to stock mate. The map view highlights nearby locations and basic info
                such as name and approximate position.

            <h2>Project Status</h2>
            <p>
                Mate Maps is an experimental hobby project and may not always be complete or
                up to date. Some areas might have limited coverage, and listed locations can
                change their inventory at any time. Always check directly with a venue if
                you want to be sure they currently stock mate.

                    Location: If you allow location access in your browser, it is used only
                    in your current session to center the map. Your raw location is not
                    stored on my server.

                    Search queries: City or ZIP searches are processed only to display
